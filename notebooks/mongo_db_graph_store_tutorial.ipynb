Conan Doyle once wrote, \"Each [of Poe\\'s detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed ...

Doyle has his main characters discuss these literary antecedents near the beginning of A Study in Scarlet, which is set soon after Watson is first introduced to Holmes. Watson attempts to compliment Holmes by comparing him to Dupin, to which Holmes replies that he found Dupin to be \"a very inferior fellow\" and Lecoq to be \"a miserable bungler\".\\nConan Doyle repeatedly said that Holmes was inspired by the real-life figure of Joseph Bell, a surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, whom Conan Doyle met in 1877 and had worked for as a clerk. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing broad conclusions from minute observations. However, he later wrote to Conan Doyle: \"You are yourself Sherlock Holmes and well you know it\". Sir Henry Littlejohn, Chair of Medical Jurisprudence at the University of Edinburgh Medical School, is also cited as an inspiration for Holmes. Littlejohn, who was also Police Surgeon and Medical Officer of Health in Edinburgh, provided Conan Doyle with a link between medical investigation and the detection of crime.\\nOther possible inspirations have been proposed, though never acknowledged by Doyle, such as Maximilien Heller, by French author Henry Cauvain.

He defeats an assassin sent to kill her and she departs. \\nAfter the wedding of Watson and Mary Morstan, Holmes meets Moriarty for the first time.

Holmes throws Mary from the train into a river, and she is rescued by Mycroft. After defeating Moriarty\\'s men, Holmes and Watson travel to Paris and locate Simza. Holmes tells her she has been targeted because René is working for Moriarty and may have told her his plans. \\nSimza takes the pair to the headquarters of an anarchist group to which she and René belonged, and which has been forced to plant bombs for Moriarty. The trio follows Holmes\\' deduction that the bomb is in the Paris Opera. However, it is actually in a nearby hotel, where it kills several businessmen – in reality, that bomb was a cover-up for the assassination of Alfred Meinhard by Sebastian Moran, expert sharpshooter and henchman to Moriarty, for Meinhard\\'s death grants Moriarty ownership of the former\\'s arms factory in Heilbronn. \\nThe trio follow Moriarty to Germany. At the factory, Moriarty captures, interrogates, and tortures Holmes while Watson fights Moran. Holmes spells out Moriarty\\'s plot, revealing that the Professor acquired shares in multiple war profiteering companies and intends to instigate a major world war to make himself a fortune.\\nWatson uses a cannon to destroy the watchtower in which Moran is concealed.

Sherlock Holmes takes the letter and places the bomb in a sarcophagus to explode, while Adler and Hoffmanstahl escape. \\n\\nHoffmanstahl is subsequently assassinated, while Adler’s employer, Professor James Moriarty, poisons and kills her, deeming her compromised. Holmes discloses to his friend, Dr. John Watson, at 221B Baker Street that he has connected seemingly unrelated murders, terrorist attacks, and business acquisitions to Moriarty. \\nAfter meeting with his brother Mycroft at Watson\\'s bachelor party, Holmes meets with Romani fortune-teller Madame Simza, the intended recipient of the letter he took from Adler, sent by her brother René. He defeats an assassin sent to kill her and she departs. \\nAfter the wedding of Watson and Mary Morstan, Holmes meets Moriarty for the first time. Moriarty taunts him about murdering Adler and threatens to kill Watson and Mary due to Holmes\\' interference, while the detective vows to defeat him.\\nMoriarty\\'s men ambush Watson and Mary on a train to their honeymoon in Brighton. Holmes throws Mary from the train into a river, and she is rescued by Mycroft. After defeating Moriarty\\'s men, Holmes and Watson travel to Paris and locate Simza. Holmes tells her she has been targeted because René is working for Moriarty and may have told her his plans. \\nSimza takes the pair to the headquarters of an anarchist group to which she and René belonged, and which has been forced to plant bombs for Moriarty. The trio follows Holmes\\' deduction that the bomb is in the Paris Opera. However, it is actually in a nearby hotel, where it kills several businessmen – in reality, that bomb was a cover-up for the assassination of Alfred Meinhard by Sebastian Moran, expert sharpshooter and henchman to Moriarty, for Meinhard\\'s death grants Moriarty ownership of the former\\'s arms factory in Heilbronn. \\nThe trio follow Moriarty to Germany. At the factory, Moriarty captures, interrogates, and tortures Holmes while Watson fights Moran. Holmes spells out Moriarty\\'s plot, revealing that the Professor acquired shares in multiple war profiteering companies and intends to instigate a major world war to make himself a fortune.\\nWatson uses a cannon to destroy the watchtower in which Moran is concealed.

       "'Sherlock Holmes () is a fictional detective created by British author Arthur Conan Doyle. Referring to himself as a \"consulting detective\" in his stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation, deduction, forensic science and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.\\nThe character Sherlock Holmes first appeared in print in 1887\\'s A Study in Scarlet. His popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras between 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes\\'s friend and biographer, Dr. John H. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories begin.\\nThough not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best-known. By the 1990s, over 25,000 stage adaptations, films, television productions, and publications had featured the detective, and Guinness World Records lists him as the most portrayed human literary character in film and television history. Holmes\\'s popularity and fame are such that many have believed him to be not a fictional character but an actual individual; numerous literary and fan societies have been founded on this pretence. Avid readers of the Holmes stories helped create the modern practice of fandom, with the Sherlock Holmes fandom being one of the first cohesive fan communities in the world. The character and stories have had a profound and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole, with the original tales, as well as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle, being adapted into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years.\\n\\n\\n== Inspiration for the character ==\\n\\nEdgar Allan Poe\\'s C. Auguste Dupin is generally acknowledged as the first detective in fiction and served as the prototype for many later characters, including Holmes. Conan Doyle once wrote, \"Each [of Poe\\'s detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed ... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\" Similarly, the stories of Émile Gaboriau\\'s Monsieur Lecoq were extremely popular at the time Conan Doyle began writing Holmes, and Holmes\\'s speech and behaviour sometimes follow those of Lecoq. Doyle has his main characters discuss these literary antecedents near the beginning of A Study in Scarlet, which is set soon after Watson is first introduced to Holmes. Watson attempts to compliment Holmes by comparing him to Dupin, to which Holmes replies that he found Dupin to be \"a very inferior fellow\" and Lecoq to be \"a miserable bungler\".\\nConan Doyle repeatedly said that Holmes was inspired by the real-life figure of Joseph Bell, a surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, whom Conan Doyle met in 1877 and had worked for as a clerk. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing broad conclusions from minute observations. However, he later wrote to Conan Doyle: \"You are yourself Sherlock Holmes and well you know it\". Sir Henry Littlejohn, Chair of Medical Jurisprudence at the University of Edinburgh Medical School, is also cited as an inspiration for Holmes. Littlejohn, who was also Police Surgeon and Medical Officer of Health in Edinburgh, provided Conan Doyle with a link between medical investigation and the detection of crime.\\nOther possible inspirations have been proposed, though never acknowledged by Doyle, such as Maximilien Heller, by French author Henry Cauvain. In this 1871 novel (sixteen years before the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes), Henry Cauvain imagined a depressed, anti-social, opium-smok'"
